Known issues
*************************************

On some hosts magic_quotes() functions are enabled by default. using that with this script will cause it not to run properly. disable magic quotes in the cpanel in the php.ini file.

On some hosts you will not be able to save settings, If this happens to you change the whole script folder's permissions to '777'
If you have trouble and have no idea what this is, https://www.google.com/search?q=chmod+777
